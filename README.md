# Climate Data Lab Tutorials
Whats up everyone,

Thank you for checking out the climate data lab git hub!

This repository contains the typed out tutorials listed (or soon to be listed) on the [climate data lab website](https://climate-datalab.org/). 

Tutorials at the top of this repository are for just starting out how to climate model and as it goes down the list it will get more advanced.

If you have code of your own you would love to add to this repository please email me at fhozven@ucsb.edu 

Hope this helps and again visit [climate data lab](https://climate-datalab.org/) for more information and video walkthroughs.

Best,

Fletcher Hozven
