# Climate Data Lab Tutorials
Hello all,

Thank you for checking out the climate data lab git hub!

This repository contains the typed out tutorials listed (or soon to be listed) on the climate data lab website. Videos will be posted on the climate data lab website. So be sure to check that out.

Tutorials at the top of this repository are for just starting out how to climate model and as it goes down the list it will get more advanced.

If you have code of your own you would love to add to this repository please email me at fhozven@ucsb.edu 

Hope this helps and again visit [climate data lab](https://climate-datalab.org/) for more information!

Best,
Fletcher Hozven
